This is the source code of the button box made on the Teensa 3.2 (Arduino), the SimHub software is used for the LCD display.
* 27 functional buttons,
* LCD display with two lines

The display can be freely configured, eg show fuel consumption, lap time, time remaining until the end of the race in games like Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2, iRacing and many other simracing titles. The total cost of the whole is about 65 EUR.

The process of making and functionalities is described on my blog (in Polish): "[Jak zrobiÄ‡ simracingowy button box](https://fullthrottle.pl/jak-zrobic-simracingowy-button-box)".
